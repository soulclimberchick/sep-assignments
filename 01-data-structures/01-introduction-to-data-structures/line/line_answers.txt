Q: How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

A: Developers can add members to the end of the line, remove and search members which utilizes the push and slice.
They can check to see if the person searched for exists, if it does, it returns the value.
They can also see who is first and last using the standard .first and .last methods.
They can then take the total number of objects and divide by two, to find the middle.

Q: If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure,
how would you search for it?

A: The developer would and search by member name and not allow a an empty search.
