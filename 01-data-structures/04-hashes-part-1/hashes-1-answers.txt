Q: Explain why doubling the size of the underlying array of your HashClass may be a poor idea

A: Doubling the size of the array from the beginning causes more work for the processor and memory for no reason
and there is not a guarantee that the empty spaces will be filled, so you've then created more work for nothing.
It makes more sense to grow the array as needed. As noted in the assignment, increasing the opportunity
for more fragmentation is also costly as it can lead to data corruption.
